# diplomas_and_disadvantage
Automation and Workflows Final Project

Updated project proposal can be found in the *Project Proposal* PDF. 

*create_map.py* contains two functions: *collectAndClean* and *createMap*. By running the file with *python create_map.py*, these functions will be run and save the resulting map. The functions can also be imported into a Python script and run separately. 

The *raw_data* folder contains two data files: *CSV_10312024-789.csv*, which contains the information for U.S. postsecondary institutions downloaded from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, and *Index of Deep Disadvantage - Updated.xlsx*, which contains metrics of disadvantage for every U.S. county and the top 500 cities. More information about where these files come from is included in the write-up.

The *figures* folder contains the map generated by *createMap*. You can download it and open it in a browser to see and interact with the map.
